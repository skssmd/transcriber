## 3. FINANCIAL CONCERNS

### Card/Money Issues

- **Sunday:** Card declined, only £11 remaining
- Dean repeatedly claims money stolen/missing - happens monthly
- Dean changes bank cards monthly due to alleged theft
- **Pattern:** Dean has parties with friends, then claims money missing

### Evidence Collected
- Khalipha took video of messy house to prove Dean had party
- Video intended to counter Dean's claims of not knowing where money went
- Khalipha took photo of ATM balance showing low funds
- **Video was later sent to Shock (Dean's friend)** but then deleted

---

## 4. SAFEGUARDING CONCERNS RAISED

### Visitor Access Protocol Violations
- Khalipha allowed unknown person into service user's home
- Did not ask visitor's name before consulting Dean
- Did not verify identity or relationship
- **Previous police warning:** No friends should be allowed in Dean's house (from past incident)

### Risk Assessment Failures
- No risk assessment conducted before allowing entry
- Service user safety not prioritized despite unknown visitor
- Khalipha relied on Dean's consent without independent judgment
- Dean has capacity but history of poor judgment with friends

### Documentation Failures
- **Incident not reported to management**
- No notes written about visitor
- No incident report filed
- Video evidence shared with Dean's friend (Shock) - GDPR violation
- Khalipha's rationale: "Nothing happened, guy just came and left"

## 7. Khalipha'S JUSTIFICATIONS & REASONING

### Why She Allowed Jay In
- "Dean said let him in"
- "Dean has capacity - it's his house"
- "The guy didn't knock, he was just standing there"
- "I asked Dean first before letting him in"
- "Guy didn't stay long, no fight occurred"
- "Door was already open, guy found me outside"

### Why She Didn't Report
- "This happens all the time with Dean"
- "Dean always has friends over and money goes missing"
- "Nothing harmful happened - guy just got phone and left"
- "No fight, no shouting, no danger"
- "Dean's house is always dirty like this"
- "I report the serious things (blood, beatings, medication theft)"
- "Management doesn't do anything anyway - same pattern repeats"

### Why She Took Video
- To protect herself from Dean's accusations
- Dean already complained about missing money before she saw messy room
- Knew Dean would blame others for missing money
- Wanted evidence Dean had party and knew where money went
- "Dean always says 'I don't know where my money is' but house shows he had friends over"

### Why She Shared Video with Shock
- Shock told her "they stole Dean's money again"
- Wanted to show Shock that Dean had party, so money wasn't stolen
- Realized mistake and deleted video 5-10 minutes after sending
- Didn't resend when Shock requested it again

## 8. MANAGEMENT CONCERNS IDENTIFIED

### Policy Violations
1. **Visitor Protocol:** Allowed unauthorized person without proper verification
2. **Incident Reporting:** Failed to document/report incident
3. **GDPR Breach:** Shared service user video with third party (Shock)
4. **Risk Assessment:** No risk assessment before allowing entry
5. **Professional Boundaries:** Has Dean's friends' phone numbers
6. **PIN Handling:** Accepted Dean's PIN (should use contactless only)

### Training Gaps
- Understanding of incident reporting requirements
- Risk assessment procedures
- Professional boundaries with service users and their associates
- GDPR and data protection
- Safeguarding protocols
- When to escalate to management

### Systemic Issues
- Dean's capacity vs. safety concerns creates gray area
- Previous police/social services involvement ineffective
- Pattern of Dean refusing help/advice
- Carers caught between Dean's autonomy and safety concerns
- Dean's aggressive responses when carers refuse friend access

---

## 9. Khalipha'S UNDERSTANDING & LEARNING

### What Khalipha Now Understands
- **Must report everything** - small or large incidents
- Should not have Dean's friends' phone numbers
- Should not share information/videos with Dean's friends
- Should not accept PINs from service users (use contactless only)
- Must conduct risk assessment before any action
- Should call management when unsure

### Khalipha's Commitments Going Forward
1. **Will NOT open door for anyone** at Dean's house (except management/authorized)
2. **Will lock herself inside** when at Dean's to avoid unexpected visitors
3. **Will call Camelita** if someone knocks/Dean asks her to open
4. **Will tell Dean to open door himself** if he insists on letting friends in
5. **Will document everything** - even minor incidents
6. **Will complete all assigned training**
7. **Will use Body Cam microphone** to capture detailed notes efficiently
8. **Will not accept PINs** - use contactless only (max £100 shopping)
9. **Will risk assess every situation** before acting

### Khalipha's Defense of Past Actions
- "Dean has capacity - it's his house, he can let in who he wants"
- "When I reminded Dean of police warning, he said 'this is my house'"
- "Dean gets aggressive when I refuse to open for Shock"
- "I always report serious things (blood, violence, medication theft)"
- "This seemed minor - guy just got phone and left peacefully"

---

## 10. DEAN'S CAPACITY VS. SAFETY DILEMMA

### The Challenge
- Dean has full mental capacity
- Dean has mobility issues but can open door himself
- Dean asserts autonomy: "This is MY house"
- Dean's choices repeatedly lead to exploitation/financial abuse
- Dean refuses advice from police, social workers, management
- Dean becomes aggressive when carers enforce boundaries

### Management's Position
- Carers should NOT open door for unauthorized visitors
- Dean's capacity doesn't override carer's professional judgment
- Carers must prioritize safety over service user demands
- **If Dean insists:** Carer should call management, let Dean open door himself
- Carers should document Dean opening door for friends
- Risk assessment required even when service user has capacity

### Historical Precedent
- Police warned no visitors except carers
- Social worker (Daniel) tried to intervene - Dean refused help
- Case closed because Dean wouldn't accept advice
- Dean told Daniel: "This is my house, you can't tell me who to let in"
- Pattern: Dean lets friends in → money missing → Dean claims theft → no consequences → repeat

## 11. ANDREA'S GUIDANCE (MANAGER)

### Key Points Emphasized
1. **Risk Assessment is Mandatory**
   - Assess every situation before acting
   - If unsure, call management immediately
   - Don't assume - verify

2. **Documentation Requirements**
   - Notes should make reader "feel like I'm in that house"
   - Document from entry to exit: PPE, conversations, observations, mood, incidents
   - Use Body Cam microphone for efficient note-taking
   - Everything must be recorded - no exceptions

3. **PIN/Financial Transactions**
   - Never accept service user PINs
   - Use contactless only (sufficient for £100 shopping)
   - Protects carer from accusations
   - Ask service user to check balance before shopping

4. **Professional Boundaries**
   - No personal relationships with service users' friends/family
   - No phone numbers of service user's associates
   - No sharing of information/videos outside proper channels
   - Maintain professional distance

5. **GDPR Compliance**
   - Use Body Cam app for photos/videos (with consent)
   - Photos/videos go directly to service user file
   - Only share with police/social services through proper approval process
   - Never share with unauthorized third parties

6. **Capacity vs. Safety**
   - Service user capacity doesn't override carer's professional duty
   - Carer can refuse unsafe requests even if service user has capacity
   - Call management when service user insists on unsafe action
   - Document service user's choices and carer's response

## 14. OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS

### Unresolved Issues
1. What happened to the video Khalipha took? (Deleted after sending to Shock)
2. Did Shock ever see the video content? (Unclear - deleted 5-10 min after sending)
3. What action will be taken regarding GDPR breach?
4. Will there be consequences for Khalipha's actions?
5. What additional safeguards can be put in place for Dean?
6. Should Dean's case be reopened with social services?
7. How to balance Dean's autonomy with clear pattern of exploitation?

### Questions for Khalipha to Consider
- How will you respond if Dean becomes aggressive when you refuse to open door?
- What will you do if Dean opens door himself for friends while you're there?
- How will you document situations without making Dean more resistant?
- What support do you need to maintain professional boundaries?

---

## 15. KEY LEARNINGS & TAKEAWAYS

### For Khalipha
- **Report everything** - no incident is too small
- **Risk assess always** - even when service user has capacity
- **Call management when unsure** - better to ask than assume
- **Professional boundaries** - no contact with service user's associates
- **Documentation is protection** - comprehensive notes protect everyone
- **Service user capacity ≠ carer must comply** - professional judgment still required

### For Management
- **Training gaps exist** - need for ongoing education on policies
- **Gray areas need clarity** - capacity vs. safety requires clear protocols
- **Support carers** - difficult situations require management backup
- **Dean's case complex** - pattern of exploitation despite capacity
- **Systemic issues** - when service user refuses all help, what are options?

### For Organization
- Clear protocols needed for service users who have capacity but make unsafe choices
- Better training on risk assessment in complex situations
- Stronger GDPR training and enforcement
- Support systems for carers dealing with aggressive/resistant service users
- Review of Dean's care plan and safeguarding measures

---

## 16. CONCLUSION

This incident highlights the complex intersection of service user autonomy, carer responsibility, and safeguarding protocols. While Khalipha's intentions were to respect Dean's capacity and autonomy, she failed to follow proper procedures for visitor verification, incident reporting, and data protection.

The meeting successfully identified:
- Policy violations that occurred
- Training and understanding gaps
- Need for clearer protocols in complex capacity situations
- Khalipha's commitment to improved practice going forward

**Outcome:** Khalipha acknowledges mistakes, commits to policy compliance, and will complete additional training. Management will provide increased supervision and support.

**Ongoing Concern:** Dean's pattern of exploitation by friends continues despite interventions. His capacity allows him to make choices, but those choices consistently result in financial abuse and unsafe situations. This systemic issue requires ongoing attention and creative safeguarding solutions that respect autonomy while providing protection.
